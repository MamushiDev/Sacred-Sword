# Sacred-Sword
An ambitious game project

Growing up playing the Zelda games, I always wondered what a Zelda game would be like if it were set in modern day society.
Would there be monsters? Corrupt leaders? How would a story work in this environment?
I would often spend hours pondering these questions, and the world that all these elements would inhabit.
That being said, and over a decade of basic story framework, I think I'm now onto something big.

As I said earlier, the main concept is a Zelda game set in a modern world filled with evil and corruption, sourced by an evil dragon thats sealed within the earths core.
The player assumes the role of a retired sheriff in the city he resides in, and is pulled into a deep conspiracy that he once tried to escape. 
Esssentially, the world will concist of 5 regions of interconnecting content and story beats, filled with good and evil characters trying to make the best of their situation. Each region is controlled by a certain aspect that plagues our culture; A mafia, A corrupt monarchy, A contaminating corpertaion, A clan of Rogue Wizard Samurai who reside in the woods, As well as a coal mine manager who works for the forementioned corperation.
Through the story, the players choice of weapon and gameplay style will be judged harshly by a morality system that changes the difficulty as well as weather or not certain characters will give you quests.
Once the player reaches the end of a main questline, they are given the option to kill or detain the leader, again playing heavily into the morality system for future encounters and storylines.

Gameplay wise, I'm looking for a spiritual successor to Links Awakening, a top down 2.5D puzzlebox I spent countless hours exploring as a child.
Sword combat, bombs and arrows will make a return, but with a twist. From the players perspective, the right way to go will seem to be firing fun weapons into ever increasing difficulty of enemies, but they will also have the option to go "the way of the sword": A slow and methodical fighting style that can be trained and upgraded through skill points that favors stealth combat. A new move set such as crawling (Metal Gear) and dodge rolling (Enter the Gungeon) will allow more interactivity with the environment within the world and a new skill ceiling for veteren gamers.

The player will have a set of facilities throughout the world that hold a key item for entering a near by dungeon, and these facilities will have a few set paths of interaction; loud guns ablazing like hotline miami or quiet and stealthy akin to mission impossible, again there is a harsh morality that punishes the easiest way and rewards the way of the sword. Depending on how these facilities are cleared, future facilities will have stronger enemies and harsh reinforcements.

Now for the exciting stuff.

After obtaining finally entering the first dungeon, the player will soon realize that no matter what dungeon they begin with, every floor is infested with monsters and human corpses. It will be revealed through a show not tell way that theres alot more to the world than whats going on the surface (pun intended) and by the end of the game find that the source of corruption and mans will to live in self interest came from the dragon at the core all along. This will progress the narritive into a second phase of the plot, where society starts to collapse and all hell breaks loose, literally. By phase 3, there will be a zombie apocolypse that raveges the enitire game world, with plenty of variety for monster types.

In this log, I will document my journey to making this mere day dream a reality.
